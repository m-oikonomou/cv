about: '
  Having graduated with an <b>Automation Engineer</b> degree, I aspire to expand my 
  knowledge in the IT field by keeping up with relevant seminars and training 
  courses. I consider teamwork to be a source of inspiration, while managing 
  to face stressful conditions with patience and consistency. Two of my most 
  valuable future goals are to get involved into some Computer Vision research 
  and persue hiking on Mount Everest.
